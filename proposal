### Proposal
Proposal to eliminate the future use of QEarn Smart Contract and reallocate its 100B Qu weekly allocation to permanent burns and CCF funding.

### Available Options

>Option 0: No, I don’t want 

>Option 1: Yes, I want to eliminate the future use QEarn contract and reallocate 100B Qu per week to burns and CCF funding

### Details

The QEarn Smart Contract was introduced as a mechanism to lock supply and reduce circulating Qu, incentivizing holders while providing deflationary pressure. With 23 epochs of usage and data, it is time to reassess its impact and determine if the contract has fulfilled its purpose.

Data shows that while QEarn has locked an average of 1T Qu over 23 epochs (825B in the last 10), the total burned through QEarn is `188B Qus`. In comparison, a weekly burn of 50B Qu would have resulted in `1,180B Qus` removed. QEarn has delivered only *16%* of that impact. Today, Qubic sees \$2–5MM in weekly trading volume. QEarn has locked 825B on average the past 10 Epochs. The USD value of weekly QEarn locks is around $1.1MM, or just 4.5% of weekly volume (assuming 3.5MM USD daily volume), offering _marginal price defense_.

Looking ahead, Qubic aims for $10MM in daily trading volume to qualify for Tier 1 exchange listings. At that scale, the weekly sell pressure from QEarn unlocks would account for 1.5% of total volume, clearly showing that Qubic’s long-term goals far outweigh any short-term benefits from continued QEarn incentives.

The ecosystem and core team are currently requesting 39B and 47B Qu monthly, respectively. QEarn’s CCF allocation could fully fund these twice over. Additionally, removing QEarn's 50B weekly burn reversal (~$70K USD market value) would **represent the same as 204 XMR weekly burns**. This aligns Qubic more closely with deflationary aspirations.

With a halving proposal on the horizon to reduce supply to 425B weekly, continuing QEarn’s reversal of burn commitments introduces  uncertainty. It's time to show Quorum and markets that Qubic honors its tokenomics.

Whatever is currently locked within QEarn should be honored. No reversal of currently locked or allocated Qu's should be reversed. This proposal is to eliminate future use of the SC.


### What will this reallocation do?

* Eliminate the future use of QEarn Smart Contract permanently.
* Honor existing QEarn users who have locked.
* Redirect 100B Qu per week to:
   * 50B Qu for permanent burns
   * 50B Qu to the CCF to support ecosystem growth
* Remove any ambiguity surrounding Qubic’s deflationary intent


### What are the expected outcomes?

* Over `1T Qus` removed from supply every 20 weeks, *exceeding* QEarn’s historical burn output
* Sustainable funding for both the ecosystem and core contributors
* Clear, stable tokenomics ahead of the largest halving vote in Qubic’s history
* Improved market confidence and pricing effects, with stronger weekly deflation
* Alignment of incentives with future goals like Tier 1 exchange listings and daily volume targets
